## Introduction

A Rust version of [G213Colors](https://github.com/SebiTimeWaster/G213Colors)

See Commands section below for supported commands.

The last successful command is saved to `~/.g213-cols.json`. This will be used if `g213-cols` is subsequently called with no arguments. This allows the state of the keyboard to be quickly restored.

## Installing

As `g213-cols` needs to be run as root to control the G213 keyboard via USB, the following steps need to be followed to install it correctly.

You will need to ensure you have set up `sudo` access for some of the following commands.

- Step 1 - Installing - standard cargo install
  - `cargo install g213_colours` will install `g213-cols` in `~/.cargo/bin`
    - Development
      - Clone the github repository and change directory to it
      - `cargo install --path .`

- Step 2 - Creating a `setuid root` version
  - NOTE: `g213-cols` must be copied to and run from a different location. Otherwise further `cargo install` steps may fail.
  - Copy the above `g213-cols` binary to a location in your `PATH` - eg `~/bin`
    - `sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/g213-cols ~/bin`
    - `sudo strip ~/bin/g213-cols`
    - `sudo chown root.root ~/bin/g213-cols`
    - `sudo chmod u+s ~/bin/g213-cols` - now this command will run as `root`

## Commands

See [X11 colour names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names) for all supported colour names - eg alice blue, lawn green, DarkCyan etc.

Choosing an invalid colour will result in RED being used. You can also use 'random' for a random colour.
